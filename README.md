Assignment link: https://bellaeriksen.shinyapps.io/mclovin/  

## Purpose:

Primarily, our dataset would be of interest to people who are studying to be the next American Ninja Warrior. Alternatively, it could also be used for avid fans, people who watch the show. 

For the purpose of our project, we have decided to target this dataset to those who have an interest in becoming the next American Ninja Warrior and would like to know about the obstacles they will have to overcome.


## Data:

We will be working with the American Ninja Warrior Obstacle History dataset, which we obtained through a GitHub repository called “Awesome Public Datasets”. 

This repository led us to the dataset that we are currently working with--provided by data.world and assembled by a user. 

The original information was credited to sasukepedia, where the information was last updated in December of 2018. The data lists of all the obstacles from all 10 seasons of American Ninja Warrior.

## What we Wanted to Learn: 

Three things our audience would want to learn from our data are: 
 
* What are the possible locations that they will have to compete at? This question would help them gain insight on what weather they will be performing in and other factors that could become an obstacle on their path to becoming the next American Ninja Warrior.

* What order will the obstacles be in during the competition, and in what round will they face which obstacles? Knowing this information allows for the audience to plan and organize themselves. 

* What type of obstacles will competitors face? By knowing more about this, the user is able to practice these obstacles, and train themselves to overcome them for the real battle.


## The Team:

* Isabella Eriksen - I worked on the introduction and also created the interactive visualization for the numbered obstacles in each specified season, location, and round. 

* Roshani Shiwakoti - Created UI platform, created the interactive visualization-- ui.R and source.R for the bar-graph and the Conclusion, edited the README.md file
